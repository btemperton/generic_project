              analyzing bacterial populations, the assembly of metagenomic data
              remains challenging, thus stifling biological discoveries.
              Moreover, recent studies revealed that complex bacterial
              populations may be composed from dozens of related strains, thus
              further amplifying the challenge of metagenomic assembly.
              metaSPAdes addresses various challenges of metagenomic assembly
              by capitalizing on computational ideas that proved to be useful
              in assemblies of single cells and highly polymorphic diploid
              genomes. We benchmark metaSPAdes against other state-of-the-art
              metagenome assemblers and demonstrate that it results in
              high-quality assemblies across diverse data sets.",

  abstract    = "Background. Viral metagenomics (viromics) is increasingly used
                 to obtain uncultivated viral genomes, evaluate community
                 diversity, and assess ecological hypotheses. While viromic
                 experimental methods are relatively mature and widely accepted
                 by the research community, robust bioinformatics standards
                 remain to be established. Here we used in silico mock viral
                 communities to evaluate the viromic
                 sequence-to-ecological-inference pipeline, including (i) read
                 pre-processing and metagenome assembly, (ii) thresholds
                 applied to estimate viral relative abundances based on read
                 mapping to assembled contigs, and (iii) normalization methods
                 applied to the matrix of viral relative abundances for alpha
                 and beta diversity estimates. Results. Tools specifically
                 designed for metagenomes, specifically metaSPAdes and MEGAHIT,
                 were the most effective at assembling viromes. Read
                 pre-processing, such as partitioning, had virtually no impact
                 on assembly output, but may be useful when hardware is
                 limited. Viral populations with 2--5x coverage typically
                 assembled well, whereas lesser coverage led to fragmented
                 assembly. Strain heterogeneity within populations hampered
                 assembly, especially when strains were closely related
                 (average nucleotide identity, or ANI $\geq$ 97\%) and when the
                 most abundant strain represented < 50\% of the population.
                 Viral community composition assessments based on read
                 recruitment were generally accurate when the following
                 thresholds for detection were applied: (i) $\geq$ 10kb contig
                 lengths to define populations, (ii) coverage defined from
                 reads mapping at $\geq$ 90\% identity, and (ii) $\geq$ 75\% of
                 contig length with $\geq$ 1x coverage. Finally, although data
                 are limited to the most abundant viruses in a community, alpha
                 and beta diversity patterns were robustly estimated
                 ($\pm$10\%) when comparing samples of similar sequencing
                 depth, but more divergent (up to 80\%) when sequencing depth
                 was uneven across the dataset. In the latter cases, the use of
                 normalization methods specifically developed for metagenomes
                 provided the best estimates. Conclusions. These simulations
                 provide benchmarks for selecting analysis cut-offs and
                 establish that an optimized sample-to-ecological-inference
                 viromics pipeline is robust for making ecological inferences
                 from natural viral communities. Continued development to
                 better accessing RNA, rare, and/or diverse viral populations
                 and improved reference viral genome availability will
                 alleviate many of viromics remaining limitations.",

              taxonomic framework. We present vConTACT v.2.0, a network-based

              We report near-identical (96\%) replication of existing
              genus-level viral taxonomy assignments from the International
              Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses for National Center for
              Biotechnology Information virus RefSeq. Application of vConTACT
              v.2.0 to 1,364 previously unclassified viruses deposited in virus
              RefSeq as reference genomes produced automatic, high-confidence
              genus assignments for 820 of the 1,364. We applied vConTACT v.2.0
              to analyze 15,280 Global Ocean Virome genome fragments and were
              able to provide taxonomic assignments for 31\% of these data,
              which shows that our algorithm is scalable to very large
              metagenomic datasets. Our taxonomy tool can be automated and
